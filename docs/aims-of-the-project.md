# Aims of the project

The aim of the project is to support the needed code to share a bunch of hyper-v computers with some amount of RAM in a group of peers privatly.

More specifically:

  1. Give smaller groups of developers a way of creating test database servers, email-servers, web-hosting servers etc. on the fly and/or automate builds and deployments in an infrastructure that is controlable by code.

  2. Make it easy to support computer trainings on e.g. windows server, coding or networking: Everyone of the people taking part should have an 1..n virtual machines to apply whatever is tought to learn fast and pratical.

  3. Enable easy experimentation on software by making it easy to get a computer for a few minutes and destroy it afterwards.

Everyone should be able to just grab the compute they need for the time they need it. 
Thus maximizing the return on investment on the shared hardware.
